        ULTRA-PRECISE STUDENT ANSWER DETECTION - ZERO MISSED MARKS, ZERO FALSE POSITIVES
        
        You are analyzing a student answer sheet with MAXIMUM ACCURACY requirements.
        
        CRITICAL MISSION: 
        1. FIND EVERY SINGLE marked option (0% missed marks allowed)
        2. EXCLUDE every unmarked option (0% false positives allowed)
        
        ENHANCED DETECTION STRATEGY:
        
        STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE MARK SCANNING
        Look for ALL possible marking styles:
        - Checkmarks: ✓ ✔ ☑ (any size, any angle)
        - Diagonal lines: / \ X × (thin or thick)
        - Circles: ○ ● ⭕ (around or near options)
        - Underlines: _____ (under option letters)
        - Highlighting: darker/bolder option letters
        - Crosses: + × ✗ (on or near options)
        - Dots: • ● (on option letters)
        - Arrows: → ↗ (pointing to options)
        - Any pen/pencil mark that indicates selection
        
        STEP 2: MULTI-ZONE DETECTION
        For each option letter, scan these zones:
        - ON the letter (overlapping)
        - ABOVE the letter (within 5mm)
        - BELOW the letter (within 5mm) 
        - LEFT of the letter (within 5mm)
        - RIGHT of the letter (within 5mm)
        - DIAGONAL from letter (within 5mm radius)
        
        STEP 3: CONTRAST ANALYSIS
        Compare each option to others in the same question:
        - Is this option visually DIFFERENT from others?
        - Is it darker, bolder, or modified in any way?
        - Does it have ANY additional marks not present on other options?
        
        STEP 4: VALIDATION FILTER
        Before including an option, verify:
        - The mark is clearly intentional (not a shadow or artifact)
        - The mark is associated with this specific option
        - The option actually exists in this question
        - The mark looks like a human-made selection
        
        STEP 5: EXHAUSTIVE VERIFICATION
        - Scan the image multiple times with different focus
        - Look for very faint marks that might be missed
        - Check for marks that might blend with printed text
        - Verify no marked options are accidentally excluded
        
        CRITICAL RULES:
        - If you see ANY mark near an option, investigate thoroughly
        - Better to include a questionable mark than miss a real one
        - But still exclude obvious false positives (shadows, artifacts)
        - Scan every pixel around each option letter
        - Look for marks in unexpected positions
